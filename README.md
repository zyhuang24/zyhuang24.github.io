# Kobe Bryant Shots Analysis

Author: Zhiyu Huang

## Introduction
Kobe Bryant, one of the greatest NBA player in the history. He played 20 years for the Los Angelers Lakers. He is in the third place of NBA all time scoring leader,
1 time MVP, 5 times NBA champions and 2 times NBA final MVP. And he is considered to be the second best shooting guard in the NBA history behind the another lagend Michael Jordan.
In the game, Kobe can always make a lot of tough shots, which are always be considered as impossible shots. But what are the Kobe's favorite shooting area? When Kobe would start his attack mode and make the most shots? 
What factors might incluence his shooting in the game? Those are interesting questions. Recently, Kaggle released the data of Kobe's shot in his 20 years NBA career. So in this project, I will mainly using this data to analyze Kobe's shot,
and predict which shots tend to be successfullly go to the basket. Hopefully, after reading this project, you will have a better understanding of Kobe's shots.
